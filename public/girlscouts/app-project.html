            <p>In this project, we're going to design an app and build a prototype version using either Scratch or WoofJS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>1) First you need to come up with an <strong>idea</strong> for your app. The best place to start is to think about who you are making the app for, what your app's users will need, and how you can design your app around your users' needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>2) Then you need to <strong>decompose</strong> the needs of your app user. This means breaking down all the needs of your app's users into smaller parts. Make a list of every feature, screen, or other element you will need to code. The more detailed your plan, the easier making your app will be!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>3) Once you have your decomposition done, it's time to start designing the screens for your app. To start designing in Scratch, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/476462212/editor/" target="blank">find your</a>. Or you can design your app using <a href="https://woofjs.com/create.html">WoofJS</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>4) Once you have your screens laid out, focus on implementing the highest priority features from your decomposition list first. You may find that you have to break some things into even smaller sub-steps to code one by one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>5) Even before your app is finished, it is important to get user feedback on it. When people use your app, ask them to give you feedback to help you improve your designs and code.</p>
